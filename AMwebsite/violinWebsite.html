    <h1> A brief History of the Violin</h1>
    <p> The exact origins of bowed string instruments are unclear. There is evidence of bowed string instruments dating back to the ninth and tenth centuries, 
        and scholars still debate whether the bow was introduced by Europe or the Middle East. The earliest records of violins appear in the early to mid-sixteenth century. 
        The 1530 painting by Gaudenzio Ferrari, Madonna of the Orange Tree, shows a cherub playing a bowed instrument with the features of a violin.  
        The earliest written records of violins come from France and Italy, dating to the mid to late 1530s.
